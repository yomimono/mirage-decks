## The IoT Spring

<p class="center stretch">
<img src="iot-stuff.png" />
</p>


## Faster than Light?

Many network services suffer as _latency_ increases, e.g.,

+ Siri
+ Google Glass

...to say nothing of how they operate when disconnected.

> So let's move the computation closer to the data and
> reduce dependency on a remote cloud

<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


## The Past Year

* **Heartbleed**: 17% of *all* Internet secure web servers vulnerable to a single bug. Described as "catastrophic" by Bruce Schneier.
* **ShellShock**: CGI, Web, DHCP all vulnerable to code execution. Millions of sites potentially vulnerable.
* **JP Morgan**: 76 million homes and 8 million small businesses exposed in a single data breach.
* **Target**: 40 million credit cards stolen electronically.

> System security is in a disastrous state, and seemingly getting worse with IoT.


## Stronger than steel?

We earlier noted the many recent network security problems:

+ Heartbleed
+ Shellshock

...and such bugs will reoccur, now in our homes, cars, fridges

> So let's build fundamentally more robust edge network services

<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


----

## The Challenges

* **VMs are the strongest practical isolation on physical devices**
  * *But resource heavy on embedded devices*
  * *Long boot times and management overheads*
* **Containers are really easy to use**
  * *But isolation is poor due to wide interfaces*
  * *Often requires disk I/O to boot*

> Can we eliminate tradeoff between latency and isolation at the edge?


## Meanwhile, in your car...

## The Unikernel Approach

> Unikernels are specialised virtual machine images compiled from the full stack
> of application code, system libraries and config

<br/>
This means they realise several benefits:
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

+ __Contained__, simplifying deployment and management.
+ __Compact__, reducing attack surface and boot times.
+ __Efficient__, able to better use host resources.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


## Real Time Boot

Unikernels can boot and respond to network traffic in
real-time.

## Contributions

Built platform support required for ARM cloud deployments:

* **Ported unikernels to the new Xen/ARMv7 architecture**
  * *Runs VMs on commodity ARM hardware (Cubieboard)*
  * *Type-safe, native code down to the device drivers*

* **Constructed Jitsu toolstack to launch unikernels on-demand**
  * *Race-free booting of unikernels in response to DNS*

* **Evaluated against alternative service isolation techniques**
  * *E.g. Docker containers*


## Artifact: [Mirage OS 2.0](http://openmirage.org/)

These slides were written using MirageOS on Mac OS X:

- They are hosted in a **2MB Xen unikernel** written in statically type-safe
  OCaml, including device drivers and network stack.

- Their application logic is just a **couple of source files**, written
  independently of any OS dependencies.

- Running on an **ARM** CubieBoard2, and hosted on the cloud.

- Binaries small enough to track the **entire deployment** in Git!

## Just-in-Time Summoning

A toolstack to launch unikernels on-demand with low latency:

+ __Performance improvements__ to Xen's boot process & toolstack
  - *Are VMs fundamentally too slow for real-time launch?*
  - *Currently: 3-4s to boot a Linux VM on ARM*
+ __Conduit__, shared-memory communication between unikernels
  - *Low-latency toolstack communications*
  - *Currently: loopback TCP over bridge*
+ __Synjitsu__ and the Jitsu Directory Service
  - *Launch services on-demand in real time*


## Jitsu Architecture

<p class="center stretch">
  <img src="jitsu-arch.png" />
</p>


## Xen/ARM Toolstack

+ Required a **new "MiniOS" for Xen/ARMv7** architecture.
  + *Removal of `libc` reduces attack surface and image size*
  + *Vast majority of networking code in pure OCaml*
+ Xen PV driver model only &ndash; __no hardware emulation__
  + *ARM does not need all the legacy support of Xen/x86!*
+ Much less CPU available, so need to optimise toolstack
  + *Linux VM takes 3-4s to boot on Cubieboard *


## Parallel Boot

<div>
  <div style="max-width:95%">
    <img src="boot-txns.png" />
  </div>
</div>

_Improving inter-VM XenStore coordination database had scaling problems with concurrency
 conflicts, resolved via custom merge functions._


## Deserialisation

<div>
  <div style="max-width:95%">
    <img src="jitsu-boot-time.png" />
  </div>
</div>

_Methodical elimination of forking crimes such as dom0 shell scripts_


## Conduit

+ Establishes __zero-copy shared-memory__ pages between peers
  + Xen grant tables map pages between VMs (`/dev/gntmap`), synchronised via
    event channels (`/dev/evtchn`)
+ Provides a __rendezvous facility__ for VMs to discover named peers
  + Also supports unikernel and legacy VM rendezvous
+ Hooks into higher-level __name services__ like DNS

+ Compatible with the __`vchan`__ inter-VM communication protocol

Code: <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit>


## Rendezvous

<div>
  <div style="max-width:58%" class="left">
    <ul>
      <li>XenStore acts as an incoming connection queue</li>
      <li>
        Client requests are registered in a new `/conduit` subtree
      </li>
      <li>
        Client picks port and writes to the target `listen` queue
      </li>
      <li>
        Connection metadata (grant table, event channel refs) is written into
        `/local/domain/domid/vchan`
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>...and the data flows</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width:40%" class="right">
    <img src="xs-conduit.png" />
  </div>
</div>


## Jitsu Directory Service

Performs the role of Unix's `inetd`:

+ Jitsu VM launches at boot time to handle name resolution (whether local via
  a well known `jitsud` Conduit node in XenStore or remote via DNS)

+ When a request arrives for a live unikernel, Jitsu returns the appropriate
  endpoint

+ If the unikernel is not live, Jitsu boots it, and acts as proxy until the
  unikernel is ready


## Masking boot latency

<p class="center stretch">
  <img style="width:75%" src="parallelboot1.png" />
</p>

_The Jitsu toolstack listens for DNS requests and boots the
 relevant unikernel and responds immediately._


## Masking boot latency

<p class="center stretch">
  <img style="width:75%" src="parallelboot2.png" />
</p>

_But a fast client might still lose a TCP SYN if unikernel
 isnt ready, thus causing SYN retransmits (slow!)._


## Masking boot latency

<p class="center stretch">
  <img style="width:75%" src="parallelboot3.png" />
</p>

_Synjitsu responds to requests and serialises connection
 state until VM is ready and network plugged in._


## Masking boot latency

<p class="center stretch">
  <img style="width:75%" src="parallelboot4.png" />
</p>

_By buffering TCP requests into XenStore and then replaying, Synjitsu
parallelises connection setup and unikernel boot_


## Masking boot latency

<div style="max-width:49%" class="left">
  <p>
    Jitsu optimisations bring boot latency down to __~30&mdash;45 ms__ (x86) and
    __~350&mdash;400 ms__ (ARM).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Docker time was 1.1s (Linux), 1.2s (Xen) from an SD card
    </li>

    <li>
      Mounting Docker's volumes on an `ext4` loopback volume inside of a `tmpfs`
      reduced latency but often terminated early due to many buffer IO, `ext4`
      and `VFS` errors
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Summary

* __Xen/ARM is here!__ Good way to run embedded experiments.
  + *GitHub build scripts: [mirage/xen-arm-builder](https://github.com/mirage/xen-arm-builder)*
  + *GitHub libraries: protocol code at [openmirage.org](http://openmirage.org)*
  + Robust existing Xen tools all continue to work.
  + Jitsu optimises away a lot of latency at the edge.
* __No fundamental drawback to VMs vs containers__
  + Unikernels competitive with containers on embedded
  + Shipping out specialised type-safe code is practical
  + Not touching disk while booting further improves latency


## Ongoing Work

* **Multiprotocol Synjitsu**
  * Extend to the TLS handshake to pipeline secure connections
  * Add vanilla TCP load balancing support
* **Wide area redirection**
  * DNS proxy to redirect to cloud if ARM node is down
  * First ARM cloud hosting via [Scaleway](http://scaleway.com)
* **More platforms**
  * Integrating [rump kernels](http://rumpkernel.org) to boot without Xen
  * Working with [UCN](http://usercentricnetworking.eu) partners to provide home router platform for future
    deployments
